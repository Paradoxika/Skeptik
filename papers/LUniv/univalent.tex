\section{Introduction}

\begin{jogo}
In this section we introduce propositional resolution proof compression and the
definitions and notations we'll use trough this paper.
\end{jogo}

\begin{notation}[Resolution]
Resolution of nodes $\eta_0$ and $\eta_1$ is written $\eta_0 \odot_a
\eta_1$, $a$ being the pivot literal such that $\bar{a} \in \eta_0$ and $a
\in \eta_1$.
\end{notation}

\section{Lowering Nodes}

\begin{jogo}
In this section we define formely what we mean by lowering a node. Then we explain why it's interessing for proof compression. Finaly we briefly describe LowerUnits.
\end{jogo}

The problem of lowering a node $\eta$ in a proof of the form $\psi[\eta]
\odot_{a_0} \eta_0 \odot_{a_1} \cdots \odot_{a_n} \eta_n$ is to decide
whether a literal $a$ such that the proof $\psi[] \odot_a \eta
\odot_{a_0} \eta_0 \odot_{a_1} \cdots \odot_{a_n} \eta_n$ is equivalent to
the original proof exists.

This problem doesn't depend on the sequence $\eta_{i \in 0..n}$ but only on
$\psi[\eta]$ and $a_{i \in 0..n}$. This last sequence might be seen as a
clause. We call it the clause of lowered pivots.

\section{LoweringUnivalents}

\begin{jogo}
This is the main section. First we define univalent clause and we prove that it's not sufficent for a node to be lowered. Second we introduce active literals and the main theorem (with proof). Third we explain the partial regularization done by "Deletable" nodes. Fourth we give the algorithm. Fifth we prove it's always better than LowerUnits.
\end{jogo}

We would like to extend LowerUnits presented in \cite{LURPI}. Intuitively,
if a node with a clause $a$ is already marked to be lowered, another node with
a clause $\bar{a},b$ might be lowered too.

\subsection{Univalent Clauses}

The extended unit concept intuitively presented above can be formely defined as
univalent clause.

\begin{definition}[Valent literal]
A literal $a$ is said to be valent w.r.t. a clause $\Delta$ iff $\bar{a}$ does
not occur in $\Delta$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Univalent clause]
A clause $\Gamma$ is said to be univalent w.r.t. another clause $\Delta$ iff
there is exactly one literal $a$ in $\Gamma$ which is valent w.r.t. $\Delta$.
\end{definition}

Units have univalent clause w.r.t. a clause $\Delta$ unless their sole literal
is a dual of a $\Delta$'s literal. Therefore univalent clauses are not a
strict extension of units.


\subsection{Lowering Nodes with Univalent Clause}

The question now is whether nodes with a univalent clause w.r.t. the clause of
lowered pivots can be lowered.

Actually this isn't always the case. For example let's consider a node
$\eta$ with clause $a,b$, the clause $\Delta$ of lowered pivots being
$\bar{a}$. Obviously, $\eta$'s clause is univalent. But if an $\eta$'s
direct child has $a$ as pivot, removing $\eta$ from $\psi$ will introduce
the literal $\bar{a}$ which will propagate down the proof.

Hence we need a condition on the children of the node we want to lower.

\begin{definition}[Active literal]
Let's consider a node $\eta$ with clause $\Gamma$. A literal $a$ from
$\Gamma$ is said to be an active literal of $\eta$ iff $a$ is the pivot of
one of $\eta$'s child.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
If all the active literals of a node $\eta$ with clause $\Gamma$ univalent
w.r.t. the clause $\Delta$ of lowered literals either are the valent
literal $a$ or belong to $\Delta$, then $\eta$ can be lowered.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $\bar{\Delta}$ be the clause of all $\Delta$'s literals duals.
$\psi[\eta]$'s clause subsumes $\bar{\Delta}$. For $\eta$ to be lowerable,
the conclusion of $\psi[] \odot_a \eta$ has to subsume $\bar{\Delta}$ too.

By removing $\eta$ from $\psi$ only the dual of every $\eta$'s active literal
might be introduced. If the active literal is $a$, its dual will be removed
by the resolution on $a$. If the active literal belongs to $\Delta$, its
dual belongs to $\bar{\Delta}$.
\qed
\end{proof}
