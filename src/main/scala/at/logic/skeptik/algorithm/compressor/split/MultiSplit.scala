    * I've choose to not include those variables in the structure.  At first I
    * thought that including them would increase memory consumption. But later I
    * added a depth which would have been useless with a variable list. A better
    * reason is the symmetry between leaves' depth and nodes' depth. If depth is
    * replaced by a variable list, an empty list would be allowed for leaves but
    * not for nodes. It would introduce complication for the optimization case.
    * Another reason to not include variables in Splitter is what
    * I've understood about "referencial transparency": the variable list doesn't
    * have to be handled by Splitter but by the code that uses it.
    *
    * An alternative implementation would be to add a
    *    case class Trunk(branch: Split, depth: Int)
